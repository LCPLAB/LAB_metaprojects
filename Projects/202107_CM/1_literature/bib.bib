  abstract = {本研究探討廣告的訊息訴求方式、訊息正反性、訊息來源可信度與消費者 認知需求程度等四個變數，對廣告效果的直接影響及交互作用。其中，訊息訴求方式分為理性訴求與感性訴求、訊息正反性分為正面訊息及反面訊息、訊息來源可信度分為高可信度及低可信度、消費者之認知需求則分為高認知需求及低認知需求，前三者以2x2x2的實驗設計操弄，消費者之認知需求由問卷衡量而得，廣告效果則以廣告態度、產品態度、及購買意願衡量之。實驗樣本來自國立成功大學的217位學生。在統計方法上使用了獨立樣本t檢定與雙因子變異數分析來驗證假設。 在直接效果方面，本研究結果指出，訊息來源可信度對廣告效果有直接正 向的影響；正面訊息的廣告對消費者之購買意願的影響會優於反面訊息的廣告；低認知需求的消費者之廣告效果較好。在交互作用方面，本研究結果指出，消費者的認知需求程度不同會干擾訊息訴求方式、訊息正反性、訊息來源可信度對廣告效果的影響關係。高認知需求程度之消費者，較偏好理性訴求的廣告及反面訊息的廣告；而低認知需求之消費者，則偏好感性訴求的廣告與正面訊息的廣告；高可信度的訊息來源對低認知需求者比對高認知需求者更重要。再者，訊息來源可信度分別與訊息訴求方式及訊息正反性，對廣告效果有顯著的交互作用。當高可信度之訊息來源搭配理性訴求，低可信度之訊息來源搭配感性訴求，會產生較佳之廣告效果，又訊息來源可信度為低時，更應配合正面訊息。This study examines the direct and interactive effects of advertising message appeals, message framing, message source credibility, and need for cognition (NFC) of consumers on advertising performance measured by advertising attitude, product attitude and consumers' purchase intention. Message appeals (rational and emotional), message framing (positive and negative), and message source credibility (high and low) are manipulated in a 2x2x2 factorial experiment. Experimental samples are 217 students in National Cheng Kung University. In the statistical method, this study utilizes independent sample t test and two-way ANOVA to test thehypotheses. Regarding the direct effects, the results of this study indicate that message source credibility has positive effect on advertising performance, the positively framed messages result in better purchase intention than negatively framed ones, and low-NFC consumers perceive better advertising performance than high-NFC consumers. Regarding the interactive effects, this study finds that NFC can moderate the effects of message appeals, message framing, and message source credibility on advertising performance. Specifically, while high-NFC consumers prefer the messages of rational appeals and the negatively framed messages, low-NFC consumers respond favorably to the messages of emotional appeals and the positively framed messages, and the message source credibility is more important to low-NFC consumers than high-NFC consumers. Moreover, this study also finds that when message sources with higher credibility present rational messages and message sources with lower credibility present emotional messages, there are more favorable effects on advertising performance. In addition, message sources with lower credibility should present the positively framed messages.},

  abstract = {Does cognitive motivation influence how people gather and interpret information about COVID-19 and their adherence to measures? To address these questions, we conducted a longitudinal survey among European and American respondents. Wave 1 (N\,=\,501) was conducted on March 27, 2020 and Wave 2 (N\,=\,326) on July 1, 2020. We assessed COVID-19 knowledge, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, media use, Need for Cognition (NC), Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC), and self-reported adherence to governmental measures taken. Results showed that nearly three-quarters of our respondents actively searched for information about COVID-19. Most at least once a day. Information seeking behaviour was not influenced by cognitive motivation (i.e., NC and NCC). However, cognitive motivation was related to (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) conspiracy rejection, and (3) change in knowledge over time. Respondents with more knowledge on COVID-19 also indicated to adhere more often to measures taken by their government. Self-reported adherence to measures was not influenced by cognitive motivation. Implications of these findings will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Developed and validated the Need for Cognition Scale (NCS). In Study 1, a pool of items was administered to 96 faculty members (high-need-for-cognition group) and assembly line workers (low-need-for-cognition group). Ambiguity, irrelevance, and internal consistency were used to select items for subsequent studies. Factor analysis yielded one major factor. In Study 2, the NCS and the Group Embedded Figures Test were administered to 419 undergraduates to validate the factor structure and to determine whether the NCS tapped a construct distinct from test anxiety and cognitive style. The factor structure was replicated, and responses to the NCS were weakly related to cognitive style and unrelated to test anxiety. In Study 3, 104 undergraduates completed the NCS, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and a dogmatism scale. Results indicate that need for cognition was related weakly and negatively to being closeminded, unrelated to social desirability, and positively correlated with general intelligence. Study 4 (97 undergraduates) furnished evidence of the predictive validity of the NCS. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {在電子商務的時代，推薦代理人已被企業廣泛的使用，提供個人化的產品推薦。但過往有關個人化推薦代理人之研究大多關注其如何有效地促進消費者之決策制訂，鮮少有研究探討產品資訊呈現會如何影響消費者對於個人化推薦代理人的態度。為彌補此研究缺口，本研究主張產品資訊如何呈現（屬性基礎或選擇基礎）會影響消費者對於個人化推薦代理人系統的滿意度與使用態度；此外，個體的認知需求與決策複雜度會調節資訊呈現模式與推薦代理人系統使用滿意度之間關係。為驗證研究假說，本研究進行了一個2（資訊呈現模式：選擇基礎vs. 屬性基礎）×2（認知需求：高認知需求vs. 低認知需求）×2（決策複雜度：高複雜度vs. 低複雜度）之實驗設計。結果顯示，在低決策複雜度的條件下，無論消費者認知需求程度的高低，資訊呈現模式對於網站個人化推薦整體評價並不會有明顯的影響。然而在高決策複雜度的條件下，高認知需求的消費者對於屬性基礎的資訊呈現比選擇基礎的資訊呈現有較佳的評價；反之，低認知需求的消費者對於選擇基礎的資訊呈現模式比屬性基礎的資訊呈現模式有較佳的評價。基於此發現，本研究建議推薦代理人系統的資訊呈現模式應根據消費者認知需求程度及決策複雜度的不同，提供個人化的資訊呈現模式，藉以提高消費者的滿意度。},

  abstract = {S. L. Neuberg, T. N. Judice, and S. G. West (1997) faulted our work with the Need for Closure Scale (NFCS) on grounds that the NFCS lacks discriminant validity relative to S. L. Neuberg's and J.T. Newsom's (1993) Personal Need for Structure (PNS) Scale and is multidimensional, which, so they claim, renders the use of its total score inadmissible. By contrast, the present authors show that neither of the above assertions is incompatible with the underlying need for closure theory. Relations between NFCS and the PNS are to be expected, as these were designed to operationalize the very same construct (of need for closure). Furthermore, no unidimensionality of the NFCS has been claimed, and none is required to use its total score for testing various theoretically derived predictions. An instrument's ultimate utility hinges on theoretical considerations and empirical evidence rather than on questionable psychometric dogma unrelated to the substantive matters at hand.
