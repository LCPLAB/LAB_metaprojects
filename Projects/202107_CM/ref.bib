  abstract = {Does cognitive motivation influence how people gather and interpret information about COVID-19 and their adherence to measures? To address these questions, we conducted a longitudinal survey among European and American respondents. Wave 1 (N\,=\,501) was conducted on March 27, 2020 and Wave 2 (N\,=\,326) on July 1, 2020. We assessed COVID-19 knowledge, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, media use, Need for Cognition (NC), Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC), and self-reported adherence to governmental measures taken. Results showed that nearly three-quarters of our respondents actively searched for information about COVID-19. Most at least once a day. Information seeking behaviour was not influenced by cognitive motivation (i.e., NC and NCC). However, cognitive motivation was related to (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) conspiracy rejection, and (3) change in knowledge over time. Respondents with more knowledge on COVID-19 also indicated to adhere more often to measures taken by their government. Self-reported adherence to measures was not influenced by cognitive motivation. Implications of these findings will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Visual motion or flashing lights can evoke auditory sensations in some people. This large-scale internet study aimed to validate a combined subjective/objective test of the genuineness of this putative form of synaesthesia (visually-evoked auditory response, vEAR). Correlations were measured between each individual's ratings of the vividness of auditory sensations evoked by a series of looping videos, and measurement of the videos' physical low-level motion energy, calculated using Adelson and Bergen’s (1985) computational model of low-level visual motion processing. The strength of this association for each individual provided a test of how strongly subjective vEAR was driven by objective motion energy (‘ME-sensitivity’). A second aim was to infer whether vEAR depends on cortical excitation and/or disinhibition of early visual and/or auditory brain areas. To achieve this, correlations were measured between the above vEAR measures and visual contrast surround-suppression, which is thought to index lateral inhibition in the early visual system. As predicted by a disinhibition account of vEAR, video ratings were overall higher in individuals showing weaker surround-suppression. Interestingly, surround-suppression and ME-sensitivity did not correlate. Additionally, both surround-suppression and ME-sensitivity each independently predicted different clusters of trait measures selected for their possible association with cortical excitability and/or disinhibition: Surround-suppression was associated with vEAR self-ratings and auditory-evoked visual phosphenes, while ME-sensitivity was independently associated with ratings of other traits including susceptibility to migraine and pattern glare. Altogether, these results suggest there are two independent mechanisms underlying vEAR and its associated traits, based putatively on cortical disinhibition versus excitability.},

  abstract = {The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population—a striking observation called Simpson’s paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson’s paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations – potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by drawing on empirical results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, psychopathology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson’s Paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered—including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson’s Paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

  abstract = {Phenomenological control is the ability to generate experiences to meet expectancies. There are stable trait differences in this ability, as shown by responses to imaginative suggestions of, for example, paralysis, amnesia, and auditory, visual, gustatory and tactile hallucinations. Phenomenological control has primarily been studied within the context of hypnosis, in which suggestions are delivered following a hypnotic induction. Reports of substantial relationships between phenomenological control in a hypnotic context (hypnotisability) and experimental measures (e.g., the rubber hand illusion) suggest the need for a broad investigation of the influence of phenomenological control in psychological experiments. However, hypnosis is not required for successful responding. Because misconceptions about the hypnotic context may influence hypnotisability scores, a non-hypnotic scale which better matches the contextual expectancies of other experiments and avoids the hypnotic context is potentially better suited for such investigation. We present norms for the Phenomenological Control Scale (PCS), an adaptation of the Sussex Waterloo Scale of Hypnotisability (SWASH) which is free of the hypnotic context. Mean scores for the PCS are higher than for SWASH, and the subjective scales of PCS and SWASH show similar reliability. The PCS subjective scale is a reliable tool for measuring trait response to imaginative suggestion (i.e., phenomenological control) outside the context of hypnosis.}

  abstract = {Up to 40\% of people report visually evoked auditory responses (vEARs; for example, ‘hearing’ sounds in response to watching silent videos). We investigate the degree to which vEAR experiences may arise from phenomenological control, i.e. from the way people can control their experience to meet expectancies arising from imaginative suggestion. In the experimental situation, expectancies arise from demand characteristics (cues which communicate beliefs about experimental aims to participants). Trait phenomenological control has been shown to substantially predict experimental measures of changes in ‘embodiment’ experience in which demand characteristics are not controlled (e.g., mirror touch and pain, and experiences of ownership of a fake hand). Here we report substantial relationship between scores on the Phenomenological Control Scale (PCS; a test of direct imaginative suggestion) and vEAR scores (reports of auditory experience for silent videos) which indicate that vEAR experience may be an implicit imaginative suggestion effect. This study demonstrates that relationships of trait phenomenological control with subjective reports about experience are not limited to embodiment and may confound a wide range of measures in psychological science.},

We investigated nine well-known effects from the cognitive psychology literature—three each from the domains of perception/action, memory, and language, respectively—and found that they are highly reproducible. Not only can they be reproduced in online environments, but they also can be reproduced with nonnaïve participants with no reduction of effect size. Apparently, some cognitive tasks are so constraining that they encapsulate behavior from external influences, such as testing situation and prior recent experience with the experiment to yield highly robust effects.},
