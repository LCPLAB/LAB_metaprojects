Um sicherzustellen, dass diese KLARtexte das öffentliche Interesse an psychologischen Fragestellungen repräsentieren, wurden im Rahmen zweier Studien über 4.000 Personen befragt, zu welchen psychologischen Themen sie gerne mehr Informationen hätten. Die daraus resultierenden 20 Interessenkategorien werden mit diesem Katalog vorgestellt, welcher als Selektionskriterium für das Verfassen von KLARtexten für künftige KLARtext-Autorinnen und -Autoren dienen soll. Die Interessenkategorien werden im Katalog den zugehörigen Teilgebieten der Psychologie zugeordnet und mit einer in der Psychologie verwendeten Bezeichnung und Beschreibung versehen.

Moreover, in line with the easiness effect of science popularization, individuals perceived plain language summaries as more credible and were more confident about their ability to make a decision based on plain language summaries. If and under which circumstances this higher perceived credibility is justified, is discussed together with other practical implications and theoretical implications of our findings. In sum, our research further strengthens arguments for providing plain language summaries of psychological research findings by demonstrating that they actually work in practice.},

This is partly due to the fact that such articles use technical terms and statistical concepts without explaining them, since they are considered to be common knowledge for their scientific audience. Additionally, researchers may tend to pay more attention to the scientific relevance of their findings and less attention to their practical relevance to the broader public when discussing them in scientific publications. To address these problems, plain language summaries (PLS)—easily comprehensible research summaries that complement scientific abstracts—were introduced. With the aim to develop empirically validated guidelines for writing PLS in psychology, the Leibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID) started the project “PLan Psy”. This project aims at finding a standardized way to translate findings of psychological meta-analyses into PLS. This protocol outlines the design of the second empirical study of PLan Psy, which will, by applying an experimental design, investigate psychology-specific aspects of how to optimally communicate meta-analytical evidence to laypersons.},

However, previous research has shown that the easiness by which textual information on a scientific issue can be understood seduces non-experts into overlooking their evaluative limitations. The present study examined whether text easiness affects non-experts’ evaluation of scientific claims even if they possess prior beliefs about the accuracy of these claims. Undergraduates who strongly believed that climate change is anthropogenic read argumentative texts that were either easy or difficult to understand and that supported a claim either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that text easiness affects non-experts’ judgment of scientific claims about which they hold prior beliefs—but only when these claims are in accordance with their beliefs. It seems that both text difficulty and belief inconsistency remind non-experts of their own limitations.},

However, the simplification of information required to achieve this accessibility may lead to the risk of audiences relying overly strongly on their own epistemic capabilities when making judgments about scientific claims. Moreover, they may underestimate how the division of cognitive labor makes them dependent on experts. This article reports an empirical study demonstrating that this “easiness effect of science popularization” occurs when laypeople read authentic popularized science depictions. After reading popularized articles addressed to a lay audience, laypeople agreed more with the knowledge claims they contained and were more confident in their claim judgments than after reading articles addressed to expert audiences. Implications for communicating scientific knowledge to the general public are discussed.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and this can cause problems in hospitals, where the virus can spread quickly. Laboratory-based tests can determine whether or not a patient has SARS-CoV-2, but these tests are not perfect and can require a considerable time to provide a result. Point-of-care tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 are being developed that may have much shorter times to a test result, although these are likely to be less accurate than laboratory-based tests. The benefit of quicker tests is that a decision to put a patient in a SARS-CoV-2-infected bay or in a non-SARS-CoV-2-infected bay can be made sooner, limiting contact between patients with SARS-CoV-2 and patients without SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the risk of infection transmission. The disadvantage of reduced accuracy is that some patients may be allocated to the wrong bay, increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

  abstract = {Background:    Plain language summaries (PLS) have been introduced to communicate research in an understandable way to a non-expert audience. Guidelines for writing PLS have been developed and empirical research on PLS has been conducted, but terminology and research approaches in this comparatively young field vary considerably. This prompted us to review the current state of the art on the theoretical and empirical literature on PLS.     Main Objectives:    Main objectives were (1) to develop a conceptual framework for PLS theory, and (2) to synthesize empirical evidence on PLS criteria. Major research questions were how theoretical considerations on PLS can be conceptualized and what the empirical evidence of their effects on defined outcomes is.    Methods:    We searched Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX (last search 07/2021).  In our review, we included empirical investigations of PLS, reports on PLS development, PLS guidelines, and theoretical articles referring to PLS. A conceptual framework was developed through content analysis. Empirical studies investigating effects of PLS criteria on defined outcomes were narratively synthesized.    Results:    We identified 7,714 records, of which 90 articles met the inclusion criteria. All articles were used to develop a conceptual framework for PLS which comprises six categories each for PLS aims and PLS characteristics. Thirty-three articles empirically investigated effects of PLS on several outcomes, but study designs were too heterogeneous to identify definite criteria for high-quality PLS. Insular studies identified effects of various criteria on accessibility, understanding, knowledge, communication of research, and empowerment. For most criteria we identified from PLS writing guidelines, we found no empirical evidence.     Conclusion and Implications:    Considerable work to establish and investigate PLS has been done, but empirical evidence on criteria for high-quality PLS is scarce. The conceptual framework developed in this review may provide a valuable starting point for future guideline developers and PLS researchers.},

  abstract = {Background: Science should benefit the public, and it is argued that scientific evidence should be shared with the public in an adequately understandable manner. For non-experts and the public to understand scientific results, summaries of scientific studies written in plain language pose one proper solution. Already, a variety of plain language summary (PLS) formats have been established, some guidelines for writing PLS have been developed and empirical research on PLS has been conducted. However, terminology and research approaches as well as empirical findings in this comparatively young field are heterogeneous. To answer the question whether PLS are effective, we see a need for scrutinizing the heterogeneity and for structuring the theoretical and empirical landscape on PLS. Therefore, this review aims to synthesize current theoretical research and empirical evidence on PLS as well as PLS guidelines. The topics we deem to be most important in this context and that we focus on in this review are: PLS aims, characteristics, criteria and outcomes used to investigate them. Objective: The objective of this review is twofold: Based on current literature on PLS, the first aim is to develop a conceptual framework for the theory behind PLS; the second aim is to synthesize empirical evidence on the effectiveness of PLS. The corresponding research questions are: 1. How can we categorize and conceptualize theoretical considerations on the subject of PLS? 2. What is the empirical evidence on PLS in general and on the effectiveness of certain criteria in particular? Methods: In July 2020, we searched four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX) and performed additional handsearching for scientific publications and guidelines that investigate, discuss or describe PLS. PLS were defined as summaries of published scientific evidence that aim at a lay readership and that use the same communication format as the original scientific publication evidence (i.e., text). Articles were included if they empirically investigate PLS or report on the development or evaluation of PLS. Furthermore, guidelines on how to write PLS and theoretical articles referring to the four focused topics of this review (i.e., aims, characteristics, criteria and outcomes) were included. Title and abstract screenings were performed by two independent researchers. From the included articles, we extracted information separately on the four focused topics with regard to PLS. Applying a content analysis method, overarching categories for aims as well as characteristics were formulated to develop a conceptual framework which integrates PLS aims and characteristics categories as well as PLS criteria and outcomes used to investigate them. On the basis of this framework, empirical evidence on PLS was qualitatively synthesized. Results: A total of 5,481 records were identified. After removal of duplicates, 4,284 records’ titles (and, if necessary, abstracts) were screened, of which 153 articles were considered potentially relevant. These were examined in full text with regard to the inclusion criteria, leading to a final set of 72 articles that were included in the review. We found 31 theoretical, 25 empirical articles and 16 guidelines or guideline-related articles. The developed conceptual framework comprises six categories for PLS aims named Accessibility (e.g., a PLS should be easy to find), Understanding (e.g., a PLS aims to provide information that laypersons can process), Knowledge (e.g., a PLS aims to increase laypersons’ knowledge), Empowerment (e.g., a PLS should enable laypersons to make self-determined decisions), Communication of Research (e.g., a PLS aims to bridge the gap between the public and scientists), and Improvement of Research (e.g., a PLS aims to increase transparency); and six categories for PLS characteristics named Linguistic Attributes (e.g., the style of the used language), Formal Attributes (e.g., whether or not prespecified headlines are used), General Content (e.g., whether or not background information is included); Presentation of Results (e.g., the way statistical terms are reported), Presentation of Quality of Evidence (e.g., whether or not authors’ conflicts of interest are reported), and Contextual Information (e.g., information about the review process). Regarding empirical evidence on PLS, we found 13 studies that quantitatively investigated PLS using an experimental approach, three studies that qualitatively investigated PLS, and nine studies that investigated one form of PLS using an evaluative approach. Because of the studies’ heterogeneity, we synthesized the extracted information narratively based on our conceptual framework. The synthesis of the empirical studies showed that the evidence of PLS effectiveness is scarce. In these studies, different criteria that each could be linked to one of the six mentioned characteristic categories were investigated. However, the outcomes on which effectiveness was shown in these studies could only be linked to two of the aim categories, namely Accessibility and Knowledge. We thus found that the empirical evidence on PLS criteria did not cover all aim categories that were mentioned in the theoretical articles. Furthermore, it did not represent the entirety of criteria that we extracted from PLS guidelines. Conclusion and Implications: Considerable work to establish and investigate PLS formats has been done, but there is a lack of consistent terminology and conceptualization. There is scarce empirical evidence on the effect of specific PLS criteria. This evidence does not cover all theoretically mentioned aim categories and does not entirely represent criteria that are mentioned in guidelines. The conceptual framework developed in this review, as well as the systematically compiled empirical evidence on PLS effectiveness, may be of use for future guideline developers and PLS researchers.},

  abstract = {Hintergrund/Fragestellung: Laienverständliche Kurzzusammenfassungen wissenschaftlicher Evidenz („Plain Language Summaries“: PLS) können die informierte Teilhabe von Betroffenengruppen an evidenzbasierter Medizin vorantreiben [1]. Immer stärker werden PLS für klinische Studien eingefordert, weswegen Richtlinien zur Abfassung solcher PLS an Relevanz gewinnen [2]. Wir haben ein systematisches Literaturreview durchgeführt, um in Richtlinien genannte Kriterien zur Abfassung von PLS zu identifizieren. Zur Prüfung der empirischen Fundierung dieser Kriterien werden ferner Arbeiten identifiziert, die verschiedene Ausgestaltungen von PLS auf ihren Nutzen zur laiengerechten Kommunikation wissenschaftlicher Evidenz überprüft haben. Ziel des Reviews ist eine narrative Synthese des Forschungsstandes zu PLS sowie zu Richtlinien ihrer Ausgestaltung.    Methoden/Material: Die Recherche fand in fünf Datenbanken (Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX) zwischen Juni und September 2020 statt.  Zusätzlich wurde händisch nach PLS-Richtlinien gesucht. Eingeschlossen wurden empirische oder theoretische Arbeiten zu PLS sowie Richtlinien zum Verfassen von PLS. Ausgewertet wurde der Typ der Arbeit und die Disziplin der betrachteten PLS. Außerdem wurden aus theoretischen Arbeiten die Ziele von PLS, aus empirischen Arbeiten Informationen hinsichtlich der untersuchten Charakteristika und Outcomes extrahiert sowie aus PLS-Richtlinien Informationen zu Kriterien.    Ergebnisse: Es wurden 4279 potentiell relevante Studien identifiziert, von denen 147 im Volltext auf Einschluss geprüft wurden. Final konnten 69 Arbeiten eingeschlossen und ausgewertet werden. Der Typ der Arbeit war: 20/69 (29\%) theoretisch, 32/69 (46\%) empirisch, 17/69 (25\%) Richtlinien. Die überwiegend (80\%) aus dem medizinischen Bereich stammenden Artikel zeigten Heterogenität bezüglich der Definition und Zielsetzung von PLS und eine hohe Varianz an untersuchten Charakteristika und Outcomes. Die Zielsetzungen spiegelten sich nur zu Teilen in den empirisch untersuchten Outcomes wider. Kriterien in Richtlinien waren nur zum Teil empirisch fundiert.    Schlussfolgerungen: Eine Stärke der gemeinsamen Analyse empirischer Arbeiten zu PLS und zugehöriger Richtlinien ist, dass Forschungslücken im Bereich der laiengerechten Kommunikation wissenschaftlicher Evidenz illustriert werden können. Die vorliegende Arbeit unterstützt damit auch den Ausbau der empirischen Fundierung laiengerechter Kommunikation medizinischer Evidenz.

  abstract = {Findings from psychological research are usually difficult to interpret for non-experts. Yet, non-experts resort to psychological findings to inform their decisions (e.g., whether to seek a psychotherapeutic treatment or not). Thus, the communication of psychological research to non-expert audiences has received increasing attention over the last years. Plain language summaries (PLS) are abstracts of peer-reviewed journal articles that aim to explain the rationale, methods, findings, and interpretation of a scientific study to non-expert audiences using non-technical language. Unlike media articles or other forms of accessible research summaries, PLS are usually written by the authors of the respective journal article, ensuring that research content is accurately reproduced. In this study, we compared the readability of PLS and corresponding scientific abstracts in a sample of 103 journal articles from two psychological peer-reviewed journals. To assess readability, we calculated four readability indices that quantify text characteristics related to reading comprehension (e.g., word difficulty, sentence length). Analyses of variance revealed that PLS were easier to read than scientific abstracts. This effect emerged in both included journals and across all readability indices. There was only little evidence that this effect differed in magnitude between the included journals. In sum, this study shows that PLS may be an effective instrument for communicating psychological research to non-expert audiences. We discuss future research avenues to increase the quality of PLS and strengthen their role in science communication.},
