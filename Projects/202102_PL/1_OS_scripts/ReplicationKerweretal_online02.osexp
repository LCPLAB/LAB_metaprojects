	Hello:<br>
	Welcome to participate in the research conducted by the Department of Human and Development and Psychology of Tzu Chi University. The purpose of this research is to explore how popular science articles can help ordinary people understand professional academic paper information. As long as you log in to this webpage through our recruitment channels, you are eligible to participate in this study without any other restrictions or cooperation. <br>The experiment process is carried out entirely in the web browser. The process is to follow the instructions on the webpage. First, you are asked to answer questions about basic personal information and existing knowledge. The formal part is to read abstracts of psychology academic papers or popular science articles and answer related questions. The whole experiment process takes about half an hour. If any force majeure accident occurs at your location during the process, please leave the scene as soon as possible, we will not provide additional insurance or compensation measures. <br>After starting the experiment, if you do not understand the instructions or stimulus items, you can make a note at any time and respond in the feedback column before the end. If you want to quit in the middle, just close the webpage directly, and the website will not keep your participation records, nor will it affect your rights to participate in our other studies in the future. If the process is interrupted due to unexpected factors (such as computer crash, network disconnection), just log in to the webpage and start again. <br>The experimental website will not record any necessary information that can identify your personal identity. In the future, the response data that will remove your personal information will be stored on a network platform with unlimited permissions in the CC authorization mode (name marking-non-commercial), providing global interest Search by people from all walks of life. The study is expected to recruit 80 people. <br>This experiment poses no known risks to your health, and if you suddenly feel unwell and feel unable to continue the experiment, simply close your browser to stop. <br>Finally, thank you very much for your participation. I believe that your participation will help us increase how the general public understands professional knowledge articles, and may inspire your interest in understanding the production process of popular science articles. If you need to keep your participation records, please be sure to pay attention to the prompts on the logout screen. If you have any further questions about this study, please feel free to contact the program host, Teacher Sau-Chian Chen (csc2009@mail.tcu.edu.tw Tel: (03)8572677 #3181) <br><br>Note: The research plan is reviewed and approved by the Behavioral and Scientific Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University. The committee operates in accordance with the norms and is an audit organization that has passed the audit and certification of the central target business authority. Any research participant who believes that his rights have been affected or harmed during the research process can directly contact the Research Ethics Center of National Taiwan University at 02-33669956 or 02-33669980.

We conducted a survey (N = 1459) among people who were active in </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>supporting refugees and providing services to them to test the hypothesis of whether volunteers in the context of this humanitarian crisis had social change motivations similar to those engaged in direct political activism.

Our findings suggest that volunteers engaged in</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>helping refugees based on motivations previously described as drivers of mobilization for political activism, but chose volunteerism to alleviate the problems embedded in the intergroup situation. Although the context of the refugee crisis in Hungary</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>may have been somewhat unique, these findings have implications for other asymmetrical politicized intergroup relations in which advantaged group members can choose to offer humanitarian aid, engage in political actions to change the situation, or do</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>both."

Ethnic identification, in contrast, was related to a stronger assignment of guilt to out-group relative to in-group, and therefore, to relatively</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>less contact with other subgroups in Australia. We discuss implications of transferring group identities and collective memories into the diaspora."

We investigated whether collective action </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intention can be improved by using a diversity intervention technique rooted in social psychology. The intervention builds on the ingroup projection model, postulating that negative intergroup relations are based on the perception of ingroups as more typical</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>of a common superordinate group than outgroups (i.e., relative prototypicality). Thereby, the (quasi-)experimental study tested the ingroup projection model’s theoretical assumptions in the context of Model United Nations (MUN) conferences. We</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>hypothesized that the diversity intervention leads to a higher perceived diversity within the superordinate group (the United Nations, UN) as well as identification with the superordinate group (UN). Furthermore, we hypothesized an indirect effect of the</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intervention on collective action intention mediated by perception of diversity of, and identification with, the superordinate group. In comparison to the control group (n = 45), those participants who received the diversity workshop intervention (n = 55) </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>perceived less relative prototypicality and more diversity of the UN.

Especially </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>when groups are in conflict, their members should be influenced by their group’s role of being either a victim or disadvantaged, or being a perpetrator or illegitimately advantaged when interacting with the respective other group.With our work, we build </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>on previous research which provided preliminary support for the assumption that group members who feel that their group is treated unfairly or even victimized by another group will try to regain power and control by acting dominantly, whereas group </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>members who feel that their group has harmed another group or enjoys illegitimate advantage will act in friendly ways in order to be accepted by the other group despite their immoral actions or illegitimate advantage. Since previous research tested </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>these assumptions only indirectly or only for very specific situations, we aimed to show that very different groups in very different contexts may pursue similar goals as soon as they feel that their group is either victimized/disadvantaged or perpetrating </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>transgressions/advantaged.We conducted two online surveys in which participants were reminded of their membership in various real-world groups.

Then, we asked participants how important it was to them to behave in certain ways, for example to be friendly </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>or dominant towards the respective other group. Our results showed that when participants felt that their group was victimized or disadvantaged, it was important to them to behave dominantly toward the perpetrator or advantaged group, whereas when </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>participants felt that their group was perpetrating transgressions or illegitimately advantaged, it was important to them to act in friendly ways towards the victimized or disadvantaged group.

However, this approach is almost certainly an oversimplification of the general public’s views towards the EU.We wanted to </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>examine whether attitudes towards the EU were more nuanced than this simple dichotomy. For example, perhaps there are individuals who are generally supportive of the EU, but opposed to the EU on specific issues such as immigration or </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>sovereignty. Or perhaps there are individuals who are generally opposed to the EU, but value features such as its ability to minimize war. We also wanted to see whether these different ‘types’ of EU supporters could be distinguished on a range </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>of demographic (e.g. educational attainment) and psychological (e.g. personality traits) characteristics.We used a large dataset (>15k individuals) from the British Election Study and a statistical technique called latent class analysis to determine how </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>many ‘types’ of EU supporter exist in the general public. We found that 10 types of EU supporter were present in the data, roughly split across leavers and remainers. Some of these types were staunchly pro- or anti-EU across a range of issues. Others </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>were more nuanced. For example, one of our types characterised individuals who were pro-immigration, but who also believed that the EU created more red-tape and were dissatisfied with EU democracy. A number of demographic and personality </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>variables were strongly associated with some of these different EU types. The classes that included majority-remain supporters were younger and better educated, and self-rated more highly on measures of actively open-minded thinking, openness, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>political trust, and external locus of control. The classes that included majority-leave supporters were older and less well educated, and self-rated more highly on measures of authoritarianism and conscientiousness. However, there were also notable </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>demographic and psychological differences within the classes between remain classes, and between leave classes.These findings tell us that viewing Brexit through a simple leave vs remain lens misses much of what people think about the EU, as well </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>as the demographic and psychological characteristics that are related to these EU attitudes. If we want to gain a richer, more complete understanding of the reasons why the UK voted to leave the EU we will need to understand not just what caused </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>people to vote leave or remain, but understand the demographic and psychological factors associated with different clusters of attitudes towards the EU."

However, this approach is almost certainly an oversimplification of the general public’s </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>views towards the EU.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>Why was this study done?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>We wanted to examine whether attitudes towards the EU were more nuanced than this simple dichotomy. For example, perhaps there are individuals who are generally supportive of the EU, but opposed to the EU on specific issues such as immigration or sovereignty. </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Or perhaps there are individuals who are generally opposed to the EU, but value features such as its ability to minimize war. We also wanted to see whether these different ‘types’ of EU supporters could be distinguished on a range of demographic </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>(e.g. educational attainment) and psychological (e.g. personality traits) characteristics.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What did the researchers do and find?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>We used a large dataset (>15k individuals) from the British Election Study and a statistical technique called latent class analysis to determine how many ‘types’ of EU supporter exist in the general public. We found that 10 types of EU supporter were present </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>in the data, roughly split across leavers and remainers. Some of these types were staunchly pro- or anti-EU across a range of issues. Others were more nuanced. For example, one of our types characterised individuals who were pro-immigration, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>but who also believed that the EU created more red-tape and were dissatisfied with EU democracy. A number of demographic and personality variables were strongly associated with some of these different EU types. The classes that included majority-remain </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>supporters were younger and better educated, and self-rated more highly on measures of actively open-minded thinking, openness, political trust, and external locus of control. The classes that included majority-leave supporters were older and less </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>well educated, and self-rated more highly on measures of authoritarianism and conscientiousness. However, there were also notable demographic and psychological differences within the classes between remain classes, and between leave </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>classes.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What do these findings mean?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>These findings tell us that viewing Brexit through a simple leave vs remain lens misses much of what people think about the EU, as well as the demographic and psychological characteristics that are related to these EU attitudes. If we want to </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>gain a richer, more complete understanding of the reasons why the UK voted to leave the EU we will need to understand not just what caused people to vote leave or remain, but understand the demographic and psychological factors associated with </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>different clusters of attitudes towards the EU."

About 30 people from each ethnic group completed our survey (87 in total).

We investigated whether collective action </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intention can be improved by using a diversity intervention technique rooted in social psychology. The intervention builds on the ingroup projection model, postulating that negative intergroup relations are based on the perception of ingroups as more typical</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>of a common superordinate group than outgroups (i.e., relative prototypicality). Thereby, the (quasi-)experimental study tested the ingroup projection model’s theoretical assumptions in the context of Model United Nations (MUN) conferences. We</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>hypothesized that the diversity intervention leads to a higher perceived diversity within the superordinate group (the United Nations, UN) as well as identification with the superordinate group (UN). Furthermore, we hypothesized an indirect effect of the</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intervention on collective action intention mediated by perception of diversity of, and identification with, the superordinate group. In comparison to the control group (n = 45), those participants who received the diversity workshop intervention (n = 55) </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>perceived less relative prototypicality and more diversity of the UN.

This research investigates uninvolved bystanders’ </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>immediate responses to collective action using a quasi-experimental field study designed around a racial justice protest that took place at a large public university in the United States. We surveyed two student samples exactly one week apart at the </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>same time and location, first in the absence of protest and then again at the time of a racial justice protest (Total N = 240). We found that participants who believed that racism was not a problem on campus had more negative attitudes toward racial justice </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>protests and protesters, as well as lower support for anti-racist efforts on campus on the day of the protest, compared to the day without a protest. These findings provide initial evidence that a protest encounter may trigger a backlash effect amongst those </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>who have the most resistant attitudes toward social change."

As negative media report about politicians have repeatedly been discusses as causes</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>for these trends, we investigated their effects on political trustworthiness in Germany.Political trust builds one cornerstone of democratic systems. It empowers a functional political system through the legitimization of its representatives as </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>well as political engagement and voting behavior of its citizens. Thereby, political trust embraces how much citizens trust the political system in general, political institutions, politicians in general as well as specific politicians. As some of the subordinate </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>agents of trustworthiness represent the superior categories, they cannot be seen as fully independent concepts. By investigating the impact of the illegal behavior of a specific politician on politicians in general and the political system, we can enhance </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>our understanding of the interconnectedness of these different levels of political trust, but also if media reports can be seen as one cause for a general decline of political trust. Previous research primarily investigated real, but isolated cases of political </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>scandals that happened in the past. Our research complements their findings by focusing on immediate reactions towards new cases. Importantly, we varied the type of illegal behavior and office of the involved politician to extend the generalizability of </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>our results.Four empirical studies with together 950 participants have been conducted in Germany. All participants either read a fictitious article about a politician’s illegal or legal behavior. We assessed their perceived integrity, benevolence, and competence </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>of the respective politician. By this, we aimed at exploring out how much citizens’ generalize from the illegal behavior to all three dimensions of perceived trustworthiness of the politician. In addition, we investigated whether reading about a single politician’s </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>wrongdoing affects the perceived trustworthiness of politicians in general and the political system. Whereas our results clearly supported that illegal behavior of a politician decreases how integer, benevolent, and competent he is perceived, results regarding </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>politicians in general and the system were mixed.Our research supported the idea that media reports about a politician’s illegal behavior strongly damage this politician’s perception. With regard to all politicians and the political system, the kind of </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>impact seems to be much more dependent of specific boundary conditions.

	setcycle 31 Content "<span style='font-size:18px;'><b>Background</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Although trust in politicians seems to decline across several countries in Europe and in the United States, the reasons for these trends have not yet sufficiently been investigated. As negative media report about politicians have </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>repeatedly been discusses as causes for these trends, we investigated their effects on political trustworthiness in Germany.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>Why was this study done?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Political trust builds one cornerstone of democratic systems. It empowers a functional political system through the legitimization of its representatives as well as political engagement and voting behavior of its citizens. Thereby, political trust embraces </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>how much citizens trust the political system in general, political institutions, politicians in general as well as specific politicians. As some of the subordinate agents of trustworthiness represent the superior categories, they cannot be seen as fully i</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>ndependent concepts. By investigating the impact of the illegal behavior of a specific politician on politicians in general and the political system, we can enhance our understanding of the interconnectedness of these different levels of political trust, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>but also if media reports can be seen as one cause for a general decline of political trust. Previous research primarily investigated real, but isolated cases of political scandals that happened in the past. Our research complements their findings by focusing </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>on immediate reactions towards new cases. Importantly, we varied the type of illegal behavior and office of the involved politician to extend the generalizability of our results.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What did the researchers do and find?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Four empirical studies with together 950 participants have been conducted in Germany. All participants either read a fictitious article about a politician’s illegal or legal behavior. We assessed their perceived integrity, benevolence, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and competence of the respective politician. By this, we aimed at exploring out how much citizens’ generalize from the illegal behavior to all three dimensions of perceived trustworthiness of the politician. In addition, we investigated whether reading </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>about a single politician’s wrongdoing affects the perceived trustworthiness of politicians in general and the political system. Whereas our results clearly supported that illegal behavior of a politician decreases how integer, benevolent, and competent </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>he is perceived, results regarding politicians in general and the system were mixed.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What do these findings mean?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Our research supported the idea that media reports about a politician’s illegal behavior strongly damage this politician’s perception. With regard to all politicians and the political system, the kind of impact seems to be much more dependent of </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>specific boundary conditions. It seems that several processes can buffer the negative effect of the decreased trustworthiness of a single politician. Although we can only speculate on these processes at the moment, our research provides the </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>foundation for previous research that aims at revealing the interconnectedness and dynamics of different levels of political trust."

	setcycle 32 Content "</span style='font-size:14px;'>By bringing together a sophisticated conceptualization of political trustworthiness (integrated model of trust) with theorizing from information processing (trait inferences, inclusion-exclusion model), our research aimed at investigating the impact of a </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>politician’s unlawful behavior on political trust. In four experimental studies, we investigated how laypersons draw inferences from media reports about a politician’s law violation to the trustworthiness of (a) that politician, (b) politicians in general, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and (c) the political system as a whole. Participants who read a bogus newspaper report about a violation of law (child pornography or financial fraud) ascribed lower integrity, benevolence, and competence to the respective politician compared to those </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>in a control condition (Study 1, 3, & 4). The perceived trustworthiness of politicians in general and the political system was also found to be decreased in one study (Study 2), which did not include items asking for the trustworthiness of the law-violating </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>politician. By contrast, two studies including such items revealed only indirect effects through the perceived trustworthiness of the politician in question (Study 3 & 4). Our results suggest that law violations negatively affect the responsible politicians. </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>In line with the inclusion-exclusion model, the impact from the wrongdoing of one politician to all politicians or the political system seems to be highly influenced by boundary conditions."

Results of</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Study 2 suggested that patterns of greater vigilance and misattribution as a function of instructions to recall engagement with 9/11 commemoration were more specifically true only of participants who reported actual engagement with hegemonic</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>commemoration practices. From a cultural psychological perspective, 9/11 commemoration is a case of collective memory not merely because it implicates collective-level (versus personal) identities, but instead because it emphasizes mediation of</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>motivation and action via engagement with commemoration practices and other cultural tools."

We proposed that a strong sense of</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>belonging to one's ethnic group would restrict, whereas a strong sense of Yugoslavian identity would facilitate, contacts between these groups. We argued that this is because people who strongly identify with their ethnic group tend to assign relatively</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>more guilt for the conflict to the other two groups compared to their own, whereas people with a stronger Yugoslavian identity are more nostalgic about the&quot;good old Yugoslavian times&quot;, and by engaging in contact with other groups from former</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Yugoslavia,they get to psychologically restore that past.Particularly in post-conflict societies that have undergone large political transformations and where ethnicity has been repeatedly constructed and deconstructed, group identities and collective </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>memories of the past can stand in the way of harmonious intergroup relations in the present.

We asked members of these communities to</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>complete an anonymous questionnaire about their contacts with other groups from former Yugoslavia, their attachment to their ethnic group, and their attachment to Yugoslavs as a whole. We further asked them to indicate how Yugonostalgic they</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>felt and to let us know how guilty they thought each of the groups was for the conflict that took place in the 90s. About 30 people from each ethnic group completed our survey (87 in total). We found out that contact with members of one’s own group</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>was more frequent than intergroup contact, and this was true for Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats alike.

We investigated whether collective action </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intention can be improved by using a diversity intervention technique rooted in social psychology. The intervention builds on the ingroup projection model, postulating that negative intergroup relations are based on the perception of ingroups as more typical</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>of a common superordinate group than outgroups (i.e., relative prototypicality).

We</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>hypothesized that the diversity intervention leads to a higher perceived diversity within the superordinate group (the United Nations, UN) as well as identification with the superordinate group (UN). Furthermore, we hypothesized an indirect effect of the</span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>intervention on collective action intention mediated by perception of diversity of, and identification with, the superordinate group.

Arguments and clashes between political opposites can quickly become heated, leading to the experience and expression of intense negative emotions towards ideological </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>opponents – especially towards politicians representing the opposing side. It is tempting for both liberals and conservatives to believe that those on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum have greater hostile emotional biases, and are nastier, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>more hateful, and more spiteful towards opposing-ideology politicians. But does one side objectively harbor greater negative emotional bias towards opposing-ideology politicians than the other?A large and robust body of research in political psychology </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>suggests conservatives are more fear-motivated and disgust-prone than liberals. This body of work might suggest that conservatives could indeed harbor more emotional negativity towards opposing-ideology politicians than liberals do – particularly </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>in regard to fear and disgust. Yet politicians elicit intense negative and positive emotions in both liberals and conservatives. We wanted to investigate whether one side of the ideological spectrum harbors greater hostile emotional biases towards their </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>opposing-ideology politicians than the other; or whether both sides of the ideological spectrum are “just as bad as the other” when it comes to negative emotional biases towards opposing-ideology politicians, in spite of the well-documented </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>ideological differences in fear and disgust. Some initial scholarship has shown that when it comes to generalized negativity (i.e., unfavorable feelings), liberals and conservatives tend to have equal levels of emotional negativity towards their respective </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>political opponents. However, no studies had yet fully examined this question at the level of specific discrete emotions, particularly in regard to both fear and disgust, but also regarding the politically toxic emotion of contempt.Across two studies, liberals </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and conservatives rated their levels of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and happiness towards Democratic and Republican congresspersons. We compared their levels of each emotion towards their respective ideologically dissimilar and ideologically </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>similar congresspersons. As expected, in both studies we found that liberals and conservatives experienced greater magnitudes of negative emotion towards ideologically dissimilar congresspersons than they did towards ideologically similar </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>congresspersons. In both studies, we also found that liberals and conservatives did not differ in their overall levels of negative emotion towards politicians in general (i.e., the average of their emotion ratings towards ideologically-opposed and </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>ideologically-aligned congresspersons). However, contrary to prior research, we found ideological differences in emotional bias. In Study 1, liberal participants had a greater degree of contempt bias (i.e., a larger gap between contempt ratings </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>toward ideologically-opposed and contempt ratings toward ideologically-aligned congresspersons) than conservatives did. In Study 2, liberal participants had a greater degree of anger, contempt, disgust, and happiness bias than conservatives </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>did.Although there are well-documented findings suggesting that conservatives are more prone to experiencing fear, disgust, and happiness than liberals are, these ideological differences in emotion did not come into play in the context of emotions </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>towards ideologically dissimilar versus ideologically similar politicians. These findings suggest that emotions towards politicians may represent a special case that overrides these general ideological differences in emotion. Surprisingly however, our findings also indicated that liberals might have greater overall negative emotional biases towards politicians who are ideologically dissimilar, and that this difference may be especially pronounced regarding contempt. This finding may be a function of political power dynamics (greater emotional bias towards those who controlled congress at the time), or may reflect an ideological difference in emotion that has yet to be revealed—a liberal orientation towards contempt."

It is tempting for both liberals and conservatives to believe that those on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum have greater hostile emotional biases, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and are nastier, more hateful, and more spiteful towards opposing-ideology politicians. But does one side objectively harbor greater negative emotional bias towards opposing-ideology politicians than the other?</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>Why was this study done?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>A large and robust body of research in political psychology suggests </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>conservatives are more fear-motivated and disgust-prone than liberals. This body of work might suggest that conservatives could indeed harbor more emotional negativity towards opposing-ideology politicians than liberals do – particularly in regard to </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>fear and disgust. Yet politicians elicit intense negative and positive emotions in both liberals and conservatives. We wanted to investigate whether one side of the ideological spectrum harbors greater hostile emotional biases towards their opposing-ideology </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>politicians than the other; or whether both sides of the ideological spectrum are “just as bad as the other” when it comes to negative emotional biases towards opposing-ideology politicians, in spite of the well-documented ideological differences in fear </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and disgust. Some initial scholarship has shown that when it comes to generalized negativity (i.e., unfavorable feelings), liberals and conservatives tend to have equal levels of emotional negativity towards their respective political opponents. However, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>no studies had yet fully examined this question at the level of specific discrete emotions, particularly in regard to both fear and disgust, but also regarding the politically toxic emotion of contempt.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What did the researchers do and find?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Across two studies, liberals and conservatives rated their levels of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and happiness towards Democratic and Republican congresspersons. We compared their levels of each emotion </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>towards their respective ideologically dissimilar and ideologically similar congresspersons. As expected, in both studies we found that liberals and conservatives experienced greater magnitudes of negative emotion towards ideologically dissimilar </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>congresspersons than they did towards ideologically similar congresspersons. In both studies, we also found that liberals and conservatives did not differ in their overall levels of negative emotion towards politicians in general (i.e., the average of their </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>emotion ratings towards ideologically-opposed and ideologically-aligned congresspersons). However, contrary to prior research, we found ideological differences in emotional bias. In Study 1, liberal participants had a greater degree of contempt bias </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>(i.e., a larger gap between contempt ratings toward ideologically-opposed and contempt ratings toward ideologically-aligned congresspersons) than conservatives did. In Study 2, liberal participants had a greater degree of anger, contempt, disgust, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and happiness bias than conservatives did.</span><br><br><span style='font-size:14px;'><span style='font-size:18px;'><b>What do these findings mean?</b></span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>Although there are well-documented findings suggesting that conservatives are more prone to experiencing fear, disgust, and happiness than liberals are, these ideological differences in emotion did not come into play in the context of emotions </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>towards ideologically dissimilar versus ideologically similar politicians. These findings suggest that emotions towards politicians may represent a special case that overrides these general ideological differences in emotion. Surprisingly however, our </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>findings also indicated that liberals might have greater overall negative emotional biases towards politicians who are ideologically dissimilar, and that this difference may be especially pronounced regarding contempt. This finding may be a function of </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>political power dynamics (greater emotional bias towards those who controlled congress at the time), or may reflect an ideological difference in emotion that has yet to be revealed—a liberal orientation towards contempt."

Yet when it comes to political targets (e.g., politicians), both liberals and conservatives can get very emotional. We examined whether the </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>ideological differences in emotion seen in past research apply to emotions towards specific ideologically similar vs. dissimilar targets, or whether these emotions are instead equivalent between liberals and conservatives. Across two studies, liberals </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and conservatives rated their anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and happiness towards Democratic and Republican congresspersons. We compared participants’ levels of each emotion towards their respective ideologically dissimilar and ideologically similar </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>congresspersons. Liberals and conservatives both experienced stronger negative emotions towards ideologically dissimilar congresspersons than they did towards ideologically similar ones. Neither liberals nor conservatives differed in negative </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>emotions towards politicians overall (i.e., on average). However, there were ideological differences in emotional bias. In Study 1, liberals exhibited a greater contempt bias (i.e., a larger gap in contempt ratings between ideologically similar and ideologically </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>dissimilar politicians) than conservatives did. In Study 2, liberals exhibited greater contempt, anger, disgust, and happiness biases than conservatives did. The need to consider context in the study of ideological differences in emotion is discussed."

	setcycle 32 Content "</span style='font-size:14px;'>By bringing together a sophisticated conceptualization of political trustworthiness (integrated model of trust) with theorizing from information processing (trait inferences, inclusion-exclusion model), our research aimed at investigating the impact of a </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>politician’s unlawful behavior on political trust. In four experimental studies, we investigated how laypersons draw inferences from media reports about a politician’s law violation to the trustworthiness of (a) that politician, (b) politicians in general, </span><br><span style='font-size:14px;'>and (c) the political system as a whole.
