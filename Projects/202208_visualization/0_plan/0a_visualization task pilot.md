### Questions
- Method: Exp2 sequential presentation is not like Exp 3 long cue.
- Language aspects: Chinese nominal phrase may have conjunction advantage.
	- "紅色方塊" is visualized prior than "紅色“ or "方塊”
	- We define "紅色方塊" as whole word; "紅色“ or "方塊” as components.

### Pilot Design

- Pilot design

See [original procedures](obsidian://open?vault=001_MentalSimulation&file=Visualization%20of%20nominal%20phrases%2F0_overview_visualization)

|Simultaneous presentation = short cue | Sequential presentation | Long cue|
|---|---|---|
| whole word on `cue_board` <br> blank on `interval_board`| component 1 on `cue_board`<br>component 2 on `interval_board`|whole word on `cue_board`<br>whole word on `interval_board`|

- Pilot Findings

| |Simultaneous = short cue | Sequential presentation | Long cue|
|---|---|---|---|
|Dual Features|762 (94.5%)|729 (92.5%)|793 (96.9%)|
|Single Feature|991 (88.3 %)|763 (92.9%)|774 (95.8%)|
|Dual - Single | -229 | -34 | 19 |

- Thoughts about the pilot studies for Chinese phrases
	- Dual feature benefit not only happened in "sequential presenting nominal phrase" but also occured in "simultaneous presentating nominal phrase". <- Are they the same conjunction benefit?
		- Would reading Chinese nominal phrase be a process of conjunct two visual representations (conjunction process)?
	- Dual feature cost would be observed in "long cue" <- Would readers require time lag to have the visualized image for identification? 
		- Would blank display interupt the the conjunction process?
	- Are there the methodological ignorance if we have English data only?
